# Lambda Layers

This directory contains the external dependency layers used by the FitsFlow server-side Lambda functions.  
Each layer is packaged as a `.zip` archive and can be attached to a Lambda function to extend its runtime environment.

## 📦 Available Layers

### 1. AWS SDK for Pandas
- **Purpose**: Provides the [AWS SDK for Pandas](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/3.9.1/layers.html) (previously `awswrangler`) for efficient data handling within Lambdas.  
- **Source**: [GitHub – aws/aws-sdk-pandas](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-pandas)
- **Specific ARN** : arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:336392948345:layer:AWSSDKPandas-Python310:25

### 2. Main Lambda Layer
- **Purpose**: Core dependencies required by the main FitsFlow processing Lambda.  
- **Download**: [main_layer/python.zip](https://www.fitsflow.org/lambda_layers/main_layer/python.zip)  

---

### 3. ASDF Lambda Layer
- **Purpose**: Provides dependencies for ASDF file creation and metadata handling.  
- **Download**: [asdf_layer/python.zip](https://www.fitsflow.org/lambda_layers/asdf_layer/python.zip)  

---

### 4. Clean Lambda Layer (Daily SDO Videos)
- **Purpose**: Supports the scheduled Lambda that cleans temporary files and manages daily SDO video generation.  
- **Download**: [daily_videos_layer/python.zip](https://www.fitsflow.org/lambda_layers/daily_videos_layer/python.zip)  

---

## 🔧 Usage
1. Upload the `.zip` file as a Lambda Layer in AWS Console or via CLI.  
2. Attach the layer to the corresponding Lambda function.  
3. Update the function configuration to include the layer ARN.

## ⚠️ Notes
- These links point to prebuilt dependency archives hosted at **fitsflow.org**.  
- The layers were **built on Amazon Linux EC2** to ensure binary compatibility with the AWS Lambda runtime (Amazon Linux 2).  
  - This means all required wheels are precompiled for Lambda and can be attached without additional building steps.  
- For reproducibility and security, you may wish to rebuild the layers locally and publish them to your own AWS account.  
- Do not hardcode these URLs in production; instead, configure them via environment variables or deployment scripts.
